# InventoPy - Stock Manager

This project is currently on indefinite pause (but not dead).

For now, we are focused on another project (Bhub - Business Registration System) to learn new techniques and finish the development of this.

## Description

## Functionalities

- Product registration: Add new products to stock by entering name, description, initial quantity, price, etc.
- Inventory control: Record product arrivals and departures to maintain accurate control of current stock.
- Reporting: Get detailed reports on inventory, including best-selling products, low-stock products, etc.
